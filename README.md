# card_game_inheritance_exercise
3 Card Games I programmed when learning about inheritance for a class assignment! :)
Navigate through a menu playing textbase card games. You can play with multiple players and see a leaderbaord, see who's playing, and remove players from the game. Add card games like black jack, guess the card, and slap jack to the game queue to play. Be wary of segfaults and good luck playing the games because I never added instructions :D
